    * You can see the output of both Android/IOS during development
    * You don't need much "Configuration" to launch the app.
    * npx create-expo-app myApp
COns:
    * Developent is little Slow as compare to ReactNative CLI
    * App Size is usually large for e.g 25-30MB

2. RN CLI
Pros:
    * Developent is Fast as compare to Expo
    * App Size is usually small, For e.g 5MB

Cons:
    * You need Android Studio or Xcode for builing and developing the App.
